Our first proper trip since moving to the UK! We are in Dublin for the weekend with Dana, Alex and Craig to see Mumford and Sons. 

Of course we couldn't come to Dublin without exploring all the sites. On Saturday we hit up the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tcd.ie/visitors/book-of-kells/">Book of Kells</a> first thing. It was quite amazing, and buying the tickets online ahead of time was well worth it as the queue was massive. After we had a look around Trinity College we went for a bit of an explore around town. We went and bought gumboots for the concert tonight, it's supposed to be dry but the advice is to wear good footwear. After an awesome afternoon we headed out to Malahide Castle for the concert. Mumford and Sons were amazing! This was the third time we have seen them live and they are always fantastic!

Sunday Louise and I headed out on our own as the others slept off their hangovers. We went to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en">Guinness Storehouse</a> for the tour. It was quite interesting, and we got a free pint of Guinness at the end of the tour. However, as it was about 10am we managed to finish half a pint between the two of us and got an orange juice. After that we grabbed some lunch and walked down to the mouth of the harbour, there is some quite famous architecture down that end of town that I wanted to look at. We joined the others at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theporterhouse.ie/">Porterhouse</a> for a few drinks before heading out to grab some dinner. 

Dublin makes a great city escape for the weekend, we had such a good time!
