<h1>24/08/2013 - The Stock Gaylard Oak Fair</h1>
<h4>Our first English County Fair!</h4>

Our first day of family holiday down in Dorset! We headed to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stockgaylard.com/the-oak-fair.asp">Oak Fair</a> near Sturminster Newton and finally got to catch up with Andy and Tina and meet the kids for the first time.
There were owls, tractors, tea, a blow up pub and rain.It all felt like a proper welcome to an English summer holiday!

<h1>26/08/2013 - Weymouth and Lulworth Cove</h1>
<h4>First day of our family beach holiday!</h4>

After trying Weymouth this morning (it was a bit too cold for our poor Kiwi souls) we headed to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visit-dorset.com/things-to-do/lulworth-cove-p807263">Lulworth Cove</a> this afternoon where it was much nicer weather! We even got to see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visit-dorset.com/things-to-do/durdle-door-p1262763">Durdle Door</a>, which is a natural formation in the rock caused by the limestone wearing down. If you stand on the clifftops and look along the coast you can see many pillars just off the coast from the cliffs that once would have been like Durdle Door before it completely wore through and collapsed.
The Jurassic Coast is an extremely beautiful part of the UK, and the rock formations are amazing, it reminds me a bit of NZ.

<h1>27/08/2013 - Studlands Bay</h1>
<h4>We are not in NZ any more</h4>

Today we were at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/studland-bay">Studland Bay</a> for the August Bank Holiday, and apparently so was the rest of England!
I couldn't believe how many people were at the beach! In NZ when its that busy we just go to the next beach, apparently not an option here. 
Our cousin also decided to completely freak us out with stories of fish that live in the sand that stab you and inject you with a painful toxin, suffice to say that Louise and I spent a lot of the day floating.

<h1>28/08/2013 - Lyme Regis</h1>
<h4>The old family summer holiday stomping ground</h4>

After hearing about Mum and Aunty Cathy's stories of their summer holidays at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lymeregis.org/">Lyme Regis</a> as children all week we finally got to visit. 
I am still getting used to this pebble beach thing, but at least it keeps the water nice and warm. 
Another thing I could definitely get used to about the English beaches is that you can buy a cup of tea as easily as you can buy an ice cream here!

<h1>29/08/2013 - Weymouth</h1>
<h4>It finally feels like a summer holiday!</h4>

After a week on the coast we finally got a proper beach day!
Mum and Grandad headed to <a target="_blank" href="http://shaftesburytourism.co.uk/">Shaftsbury</a> for the day and the rest of us hit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visit-dorset.com/explore/towns/weymouth">Weymouth beach</a> for one last day all together before we all go our seperate ways. We spent the day surfing, swimming, making sand castles and eating ice creams and fish and chips.
It has been such a good week on the South Coast, I look forward to doing it again some day.
