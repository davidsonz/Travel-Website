<h4>Welcome to the coolest place in Mexico</h4>

We have arrived in Merida in the Yucatan Peninsular of Mexico. We are staying at <a target="_blank" href="http://nomadashostel.mx/">Nomadas Hostel</a> which is quite possibly the best hostel we have stayed at on this trip. 
As well as being a great place to stay the Hostel offers free yoga in the morning, free salsa dancing in the evening, cooking classes most nights of the week, and <a target="_blank" href="http://nomadashostel.mx/tours-en-yucatan/">great tours</a> to the highlights of the Yucatan Peninsular. 
We mean to make the most of all of these things for our time here. 

<h4>Day 1: 07/12/2018</h4>

Today we are heading out on a tour of Kabbah and Uxmal for the day.

We started our morning with free breakfast followed by our free yoga session. Louise and I, despite best intentions, have not stretched or exercised on this trip nearly as much as we meant to setting out. As a result we are very stiff so it was good to have a yoga session this morning. By the end of it we were finally able to touch our toes again.
Then we were off on our tour for the day. Knowing that it would be a couple of hours driving to the sites Louise and I came prepared with music to listen to along the way, having learnt our lesson on this in the Galapagos. 

Our first stop was the "small" Puuc Mayan city of Kabbah. When we were told on the bus it was small, I was expecting a small settlement similar to the small Incan settlements we saw in Peru. The reality was that Kabbah used to be inhabited by 8 thousand people which makes it the same size as Machu Picchu. 
The Mayan culture appeared 2500BC and for all intents and purposes still exists today which makes it one of the longest lasting cultures in history. Because of this Archeologists break the culture up into three periods. Pre-Classic which is 2500BC to 300AD. Classic, the height of the Mayan Civilization, which is 300AD to 900AD. Post-Classic which is 900AD onwards.
Cities like Kabbah were built in the Classic period but the abandoned in the Post-Classic period, there purposed forgotten, so by the time the Spanish arrived the Mayans in the area could no longer remember what the sites had been used for. Therefore much of what is "known" about any of these sites, including places like Chichen Itza, is speculation of Scientists.

At Kabbah, due to its distance from any Cenotes which the rest of the Mayans relied upon for water, we learnt about their use of architecture to collect rain and the importance of the God of Rain, Chaac. You see the face of Chaac used in many Classic Mayan arctitecture and decoration. 
We also learnt about the Ceiba tree, of the Universal Mayan Tree, which represents the three worlds and their connection to one another. Much like the Incan Culture the Mayans used a lot of symbology when builing cities.

After Kabbah we headed to the capital of Puuc Maya, Uxmal. I can now see why Kabbah is called a small city. The capital of the region, Uxmal, was inhabited by up to 25 thousand in its height. There are many buildings in Uxmal including temples, ball courts, a governmental palace and smaller residential buildings. 
Again we saw many of the same symbology we had seen in Kabbah. No one knows what caused the collapse of the Mayan Elite in 900AD, it seems that there were many factors all over the empire that seemed to coincide with one another, but in the Puuc Maya region it is believed that a period of drought caused the people to flee to other regions. The Puuc Maya relied on rainfall for water, where as other areas of the empire had Cenotes, or underground lakes, that the used.

After spending a few hours each at Kabbah and Uxmal we had a late lunch at a local restaurant before headimg back to Merida. Tonight Louise and I are taking part in the evening cooking class. It is a cheap way to get some dinner and we get to learn how to cook authentic Mexican food. Tonight we are cooking Lime Soup and Salbutes, which are a lightly fried toritilla stacke with chicken and salad.
