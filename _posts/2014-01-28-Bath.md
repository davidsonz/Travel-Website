<h4>28/01/2014: An awesome day out in Bath</h4>

Today Louise and I caught the train from London to Bath. 

We set out early this morning to catch the tube into London and then jump on the train to Bath from Paddington. 
We arrived in Bath and made a beeline for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bathabbey.org/">Bath Abbey</a> while we decided on our plan for the day. In a beautiful moment there was an American Choir performing for free at the Cathedral so we stayed and watched for a while. 
The original plan had been to go have a Bath in Bath at the local hot pools and then go to the museum but, due our limited budgets as students, we just went to the museum.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.romanbaths.co.uk/"> Roman Bath Museum</a> at Bath is fantastic. 
You get taken through the full history of the Romans in England and also the history of mineral pools like those at Bath up to modern times. We finished off the tour through the museum with a drink of the restoring waters of Bath Spa.

After the Museum we went for a walk around Bath to see all the famous buildings such as the Royal Crescent, the Circus, ad Pulteney Bridge before heading back to the station.

As we were walking back to the station it started snowing. Our first snow in England! It didn't settle but was floating around us and was very pretty. It was also very cold so we found a Starbucks to shelter in until it was time to hop back on the train and head back to London.
