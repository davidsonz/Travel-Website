<h4>Overnight train from St Petersburg and Moscow</h4>

We have boarded our first train on the Trans Siberian! If this is what its going to be like for the whole trip I will be very happy. We have WiFi, individual lights on each bed, proper flushing toilets, snacks with juice boxes, and very comfy beds. This is an express train often used by business men and women as it is the cheapest, most comfortable, and one of the most efficient ways of getting between the two major cities.
