<h4>29/12/2013: Three Kiwis try to hack it on the South Coast</h4>

We are at Hastings for the day with Aunty Cathy and Claudia, who is staying with us for New Years. 

We had a great day out. We went up the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visit1066country.com/things-to-do/attractions/cliff-railways-east-hill-p1424931">Cable Car</a> to the top of West Hill and had a walk around. We also spent quite a lot of time marvelling at the views across the town and the English Channel. 

For lunch we had a very British Haddock and Chips at the local fish and chip shop. We had a very lovely afternoon walking around Hastings and the beach, and seeing what there was to be seen until the sun started to set. We also got the sourest sweets from the sweet shop on the way back to the car. They were so sour they literally took the roof off the top of your mouth.

I highly recommend a day out at Hastings. I imagine it is a lot busier and bustling during the summer but there is a certain level of tranquillity that comes from visiting in the winter. Especially during the madness that is the week between Christmas and New Year.
