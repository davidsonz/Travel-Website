Despite the strikes in France trying to thwart our weekend with Julia and Florean, we made it to Strasbourg. 

We left Bristol on Friday morning. Our first two trains (Bristol-London and London-Paris) were not a problem. However, upon arrival in Paris we learnt that our original train from Paris to Strabourg was cancelled so after a few hours at the station in Paris we were on our way south. We arrived in Strasbourg with enough time to head to the markets for a few mulled wines and some dinner. It is so amazing to see Julia again as we haven't seen her since she left to go back to Germany in June. 

That was the teme for the rest of the weekend. We wandered around Strasbourg, going to the markets, drinking coffee and mulled wine, eating lots of cheese and bread. We visited the cathedral, which was beautiful, and walked along the river. On Sunday we farewelled Julia and Florean as they caught their bus back to Germany. 

On Monday Louise and I had the slightly stressful task of trying to get back to Bristol. In the end we were on the only train out of Strasbourg, going to Paris, that left at 6am. We ended up in Paris for 10 hours, and as so much was closed down due to the strikes, we walked down to the Louvre and had a look around for the first time in over a decade. We were then finally on our train back to London and made it with time to kill to our train back to Bristol. 

It was a great weekend, and it was all worth it to see Julia!
