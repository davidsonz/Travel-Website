<h4>The big, white and empty Salt Flats</h4>

We have arrived in Uyuni for the day to head out to the Salt Flats. The Salt Flats are amazing. They are so vast, white and empty of life. It puts your existence into perspective a bit.

The Salt Flats were formed by the collision of the Pacific and Nazcar tectonic plates, the formation of the South American continent. This collision also pushed up the ocean that was between the two plates. 
The flats are 260km by 140km and are 100m deep. They are surrounded by dormant volcanos, however the sulfer gases that still run in streams under the flats break through in places to form the bubbling pools. Unlike New Zealand these pools are cold as there is no longer any volcanic activiy to warm the water.

Our tour for the day started at the Train Cemetery. Back in the day the trains were owned by private companies to transport minerals from Bolivia's mines through the desert to the coast of Chile. However when the government nationalised the mines and transport company the trains were abandonded and are now like a massive jungle gym for tourists. 
Then it was a stop at Colchani, the only community permitted by the Bolivian Government to harvest and sell the salt from the flats. We were able to see inside one of the communities factories to see how they process the salt which was very interesting. 

Then it was onto the flats. We arrived at the flats in the dry season. This meant that we were able to visit Salt Hotel, the only building on the flats and completely made of salt bricks harvested from the flats. 
This is also where the flags of the world are. Its not very official, basically any tourist is welcome to place their flag their if they bring one to hang. We managed to find three New Zealand flags (there was only one Autralian one).

It was then onto Cactus Island, also known as Isla Incahuasi, an island in the middle of the flats. From here you can get the best 360 degree views of the flats.
On the way to the island of course we had to have fun taking all the fun perspective photos you can take on the flats. Louise and I even brought a Kiwi along with us for the occasion. 
Finally we got to watch the beautiful sunset over the Salt Flats before heading back into town.

We had such a great day out on the Salt Flats, next time we will definitely do the three day tour and see all the sights. 
Though a word to the wise, cover up as much as possible and drink heaps of water. There is no shade and the salt is incredibly dehydrating!
