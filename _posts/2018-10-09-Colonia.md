<h4>Last stop in Uruguay</h4>

On Tuesday morning we departed Smart Hotel in Montevideo and made our way to the bus station. As with everything else we have experienced
in Uruguay,  the staff at the bus station were incredibly helpful and we were able to buy our bus tickets very easily. Once on the bus 
it was an easy, 2.5 hour ride to Colonia del Sacremento. 

Colonia del Sacremento is a beautiful town. We stayed in Hotel Rivera, which is literally a 5 minute walk from both the bus station and
the ferry terminal. The location was perfect as we were able to quickly drop our heavy bags off, and it was still only a 10 minute walk
from the historical part of town. Once we were checked in we made our way down to the historical part of the town for lunch. A bottle of
Medio y Medio and a plate of pasta each later and we were quite set for the afternoon. 

Colonia del Sacremento is very beautiful and historical, but you also only need an afternoon to see it. We had wandered the extent of 
the historical part of town within a few hours of being there. After that the main bit of excitement was that Louise saw her first snake
(which is unfortunate as she is terrified of them!). It popped its head out from between to concrete slabs on the pier at an inoportune
time and they gave each other quite a big fright. 

One of the best parts of Colonia del Sacremento was that the whole town smelled of jasmine, as there was so much in bloom everywhere. 
With a well deserved cup of tea, and another walk around the town as the light began to change (so Louise could take more photos),
we killed an hour or so while we waited for the sun to set. It was a beautiful sunset and a good end to our time in Uruguay. 

Uruguay definitely remains the country to beat! We have loved it here.
