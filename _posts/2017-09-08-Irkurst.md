<h4>08/09/2017: Day out in Irkurst</h4>

After an early start leaving Listvyanka (and the worse car ride I have ever had in my life) we are in Irkurst for the day before we hop back on the train tonight to go to Mongolia. 

Irkurst is quite a fascinating city. Known as the Gateway to Siberia Irkurst became the place of exile for many Russian artists, officers, and nobles were sent into exile in Siberia for their part in the Decembrist revolt against Tsar Nicholas I. Irkurst is a beautiful city, sandwiched between the Angara and Irkurst River. 

Irkurst is home to many beautiful churches and cathedrals, much like all other cities in Russia, but after almost two weeks of visiting a lot of churches and cathedrals even Louise and I are a bit churched out. So instead we went to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inspirock.com/russia/irkutsk/gallery-of-v-bronshteyn-a1321070551">Gallery of V Bronshteyn</a>, a modern art gallery. There was a beautiful exhibit of paintings inspired by traditional Siberian Culture when we were there. 

We had a lovely afternoon walking around Irkurst before having dinner in an English pub and heading to a supermarket to top up supplies for the train. Then we were back on the train to head to Mongolia. 

Russia it has been awesome!
