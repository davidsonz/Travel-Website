On the 23rd of March 2020 the UK went into Lockdown to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. We have been expecting this for a while but it still came as a shock when it was announced. The silver lining is that Mum and Dad are now safely back in NZ, and we still got to have an amazing month with them before this all kicked off. At least Louise and I have each other, we have countryside to walk through each morning as our government allocated time outdoors, and we are both still working and staying busy. 

Some highlights of our lockdown: Walking to Chew Valley Lake and back, exploring the countryside around us more, an Easter spent reading our books in the sunshine with Pimms, building our carport cabana when the hardware stores reopened, zoom pubs, garage workouts, and spending time with each other.
