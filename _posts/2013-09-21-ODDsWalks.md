<h1>28/09/2013 - A seaside walk and Arthurian Legend</h1>
<h4>5 miles from Boscastle to Tintagel</h4>

Today's walk was a lot more effort that the flat rolling plain that is Dartmoor but the views were well worth it. I can see why this is one of the most popular walks of the year. 
We were dropped at Boscastle in the morning and spent the day scaling and descending the cliffs of the Cornish Coast as we walked towards Tintagel.
We saw amazing views of the seas, which reminded me of home, beautiful outcrops and wild ponies. There was a nerve wracking group photo along the cliff at lunch.
We made some new friends and hopefully we have many more walks with them to look forward to.
The day ended at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/tintagel-castle/">Tintagel</a> which is supposedly the Castle of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and in the cliffs below the castle is Merlin's cave.
Bizarre to be in this place of both history and legend, I am starting to understand why so many History Majors are a part of OODs.

<h1>05/10/2013 - On a good day we can see Wales</h1>
<h4>7 miles from Crowcombe to West Quantoxhead</h4>

Today we completed a beautiful walk near the Somerset Coast through farm land from Crowcombe to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quantockonline.co.uk/quantocks/villages/westquantoxhead/westquantox1.html">West Quantoxhead</a>. 
In the morning President Pete had warned us that there were two big hills to climb so to pace ourselves, only for Louise and I to discover that the English idea of a big hill is vastly different to the New Zealand one. 
An absolute stunner of a day, we had beautiful blue skies the whole walk. Got to see some cows, walk through some trees and live up to the OODs motto "On a good day we can see Wales" when we got to West Quantoxhead.

<h1>19/10/2013 - Out Of Boots</h1>
<h4>9 mile cycle along the River Exe</h4>

Today was the yearly Out of Boots Saturday so instead of walking we were cycling.
We cycled from the Exeter Quay to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visitsouthdevon.co.uk/explore-south-devon/topsham-p403063">Topsham</a> and back again via the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doublelocks.com/">Double Locks Pub</a> along the River Exe. 
The Double Locks Pub is an institution, Mum used to go there when she was at Exeter Uni back in the day. 
We had beautiful weather for it and even got to see a deer on the ride back. Topsham was very pretty, would be nice to have a bit more of an explore around here one day.

<h1>26/10/2013 - The Cornish Coast</h1>
<h4> 8 miles from Rames Head to Cremyll </h4>

Today was our second walk along the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cornwallinfocus.co.uk/walking/kingsand.php">Cornish Coastline</a>, but the Southern Coast this time. Today was a bit more like the weather I have been expecting for an English Autumn, wet and windy.
We still had a wonderful time though, we had lunch in old caves in the cliffs, got to know everyone a bit better, saw an acient abandoned church and got to walk through the pristene gardens of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visitcornwall.com/things-to-do/attractions/south-coast/cawsand/mount-edgcumbe-house-and-country-park">Mount Edgcumbe Country Park</a>. We also got to walk through the quaint we town of Devonport, the English version is not so different from ours both cute little towns on the coast.
OODs is definitely a great way to meet wonderful people and see the most of the gorgeous countryside we find ourselves living in.

<h1>05/11/2013 - Guy Fawkes</h1>
<h4>Bonfires, Mulled Cider, and burning Barrels of Tar</h4>

It is our first Bonfire Night (or Guy Fawkes) in the UK and we are off (along with every other student in Exeter) to Ottery St Mary for the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tarbarrels.co.uk/home/">Tar Barrels</a>.
What is normally a sleepy little town in Devon becomes chaotic for the night as half the population of Exeter crams into the streets, and if that didn't make it manic enough there are also people carrying flaming barrel of tar in relay races through the town. 
It was cool to have an Autumn Guy Fawkes night for once. Back in New Zealand it takes a long time to get dark and because it is Spring it is already getting to warm to properly enjoy a bonfire or mulled wine (or cider if you are in the west country).
It all seemed a bit bizzare to me but I am going to chalk this up to wierd English traditions like chasing cheese down a hill. 
That being said we had an awesome night, and hopefully will come back again some day to enjoy the spectacle all over agin.

<h1>16/11/2013 - A wet walk through the Dartmoor</h1>
<h4>7.5 Miles from Sticklepath to Okehampton</h4>

Today we walked the 7.5 miles from Sticklepath to Okehampton, through Dartmoor. It felt like a proper English Autumn day, a bit of the chilly side with all the leaves starting to turn.
We came across a massive pile of rocks that of course we all had to climb (some of us less willingly than others), the views at the top over Dartmoor were amazing. 
We could see the army running drills and the smoke from them on the moor. 
We ended up in Okehampton in the evening and after waiting for ages for the Grey Hound couch to show up, we just got on the next bus back to Exeter.

<h1>23/11/2013 - Our best, and longest, walk yet</h1>
<h4>10 Miles from Feniton to Wimple</h4>

Today we caught the train from Exeter St David's to Honiton Station and then walked the 10 miles from Feniton to Wimple. 
It was a beautiful day for a walk, sunny and just cool enough to be comfortable. We were joined by Gaby (from our flat) and Louise (our new English bestie).
The walk is a nice flat walk (except for the hill at the end) across farmland and along some very lovely streams and rivers. 
Our new stash arrived today as well so everyone was in their new OODs get up.

<h1>07/12/2013 - A Christmas Walk</h1>
<h4>A 4 mile walk around the grounds and a tour of Castle Drogo</h4>

Today was our last OODs walk before the Christmas break so we decided to do something a little different. 
We headed to Dartmoor, to the newest Castle in England, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/castle-drogo">Castle Drogo</a>.
As opposed to the normal tour of a Castle you get, this one was a little bit different. Because the castle was not built with the damp of Dartmoor in mind, when we were there they were taking off the outer layer of brick, cleaning it, placing better water proofing and insulation underneath and then replacing the brick.
We got to go up the scaffolding to see the progress of what they were doing, and got to wear super sexy high vis vests and safety helmets to do so. It meant that the Castle was in a big white tent, which admittedly spoiled some of the views out the windows, but was very interesting. 
We also did the generic tour of the building and rooms and learnt about the history of the family that lived there. 

After lunch we did a quick 4 mile circular walk of the grounds before heading back to Exeter. We had a great time for our last walk before Christmas.
Louise and I taught everyone Pukeko in a Ponga Tree (the NZ version of the 12 Days of Christmas), we had leaf fights and sing offs of Christmas songs. 
Couldn't have come up with a better Saturday.
