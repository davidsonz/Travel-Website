<h4>26/01/2014: Markets, walks, new shoes and old buildings: We go for a road trip with Aunty Cathy</h4>

Today we went on a road trip with Aunty Cathy to Cambridge. <br>
It is a pretty cool place to visit. We had a look around the university, and a wonder around the local market, walked along the canals and got caught out in a massive rain storm.
