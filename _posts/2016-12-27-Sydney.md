<h3>Celebrating in the New Year style!</h3>

We arrived to temperatures of 37 degrees celcius which was a bit of a shock for us. We spent the first couple of days suffering and thinking that it was just us New Zealanders being unused to the heat, until a kind local informed us that there was actually a heat wave going on and everyone was suffering!

We stayed at Big Hostel in Central Sydney, we got a family room to the four of us and it was super comfortable. Air conditioning and a private bathroom all for $60 a night each. Big Hostel also had one of the shortest minimum night stays of all the hostels we looked at in Sydney, over the Christmas/New Year period most hostels have a 10 night minimum booking requirement to stop locals from pushing the tourists out over New Year.

<h3>Day One:</h3>
We arrived, finally found our hostel after walking around the central station a few times, and immediately headed out to explore some of the sites. Walked down to the Rocks where the Sydney Opera House is located and had a look at some of the beautiful old buildings around Sydney. 
Public transport in Sydney is super easy, there was a station a 5 minute walk from our hostel and the Opal card system is capped at $8 a day and $2 on Public Holidays.

<h3>Day Two:</h3>
The temperature soared and we hit as many air conditioned locations as possible. We got the Sydney attraction pass which gave us entry into five of the Sydney attractions for the price of two. 
Today we headed for Darling harbour and went to the Wildlife Zoo, Aquarium and Madam Tussauds. 
The Wildlife Zoo was awesome, we saw all the native Australian Wildlife and got to take photos with a Koala (though you don't get to hold them in New South Wales, you've got to go to Queensland for that). 
The Aquarium was cool but a lot of people as clearly everyone had the same idea as us about the air conditioning. The best thing about the Aquarium is the penguin section where you get to sit on a little boat and go around a river in the enclosure, it was so cold and so worth the half hour wait in the line to be cool for the first time that day. 
Madam Tussauds was a bit of a laugh, but would only recommend it as a way to kill some time and get inside somewhere cool for a couple of hours. 
We finished off the day with a walk around Darling harbour which is stunning at night!

<h3>Day Three:</h3>
Dawned hot, humid, overcast and muggy; so off we went on the ferry to Manly (with apparently half the population of Sydney, as the whole city goes out to the peninsular when the weather is like this in the main centre). 
We went to the Manly Aquarium (included in our attraction pass). I throughly enjoyed this aquarium, as it is also a sanctuary for animals that would otherwise not be able to survive in the wild. It was also very quiet when we went so we were able to take our time and enjoy all the animals and the peace, quiet and coolness that came from being in the aquarium.
After the aquarium we headed out to Manly Beach, but even for us life guards it was too wild so we headed back to the safety of the beach next to the ferry. Our first swim in Syndey was more bracing than I thought it would be for this side of the Tasman, but so nice to be in the water for the first time on our trip.
