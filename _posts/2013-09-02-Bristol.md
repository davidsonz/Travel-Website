<h4>Seek and you shall find!</h4>

We spent the day running around Bristol as fast as we could to complete the <a target="_blank" href="https://visitbristol.co.uk/things-to-do/banksy-walking-tour-p1354013">Banksy Tour</a> and find as many Grommits (there were Grommit, from Wallace and Grommit, statues all over town) as we could before the drive back to London.
I love all the street art in Bristol, it makes it such a vibrant fun city to be in!
