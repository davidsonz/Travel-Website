<h4>A proper pub experience</h4>

After driving from the Dorset Coast to Cornwall we have arrived at the beautiful Perranporth! We are staying with Mum and Dad's friends who have known them since the beginning of Mum and Dad.
We spent the day eating Cornish Pasties, drinking at the Watering Hole (the UK's only beach bar), and drinking Pimms. 
A walk around the beach even yeilded another Kiwi Lifeguard (we just keep finding them)!
Stunner of a day!
