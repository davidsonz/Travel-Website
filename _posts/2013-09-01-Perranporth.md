<h4>A proper pub experience</h4>

After driving from the Dorset Coast to Cornwall we have arrived at the beautiful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perranporthinfo.co.uk/">Perranporth</a>! We are staying with Mum and Dad's friends who have known them since the beginning of Mum and Dad.

We spent the day eating Cornish Pasties, drinking at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thewateringhole.co.uk/">Watering Hole</a> (the UK's only beach bar), and drinking Pimms. 
A walk around the beach even yeilded another Kiwi Lifeguard (we just keep finding them)!
We had an absolute stunner of a day!
