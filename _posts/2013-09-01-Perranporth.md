<h4>01/09/2013: A proper pub experience</h4>

After driving from the Dorset Coast to Cornwall we have arrived at the beautiful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perranporthinfo.co.uk/">Perranporth</a>! We are staying with Mum and Dad's friends who have known them since the beginning of Mum and Dad.

We spent the day eating Cornish Pasties, drinking at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thewateringhole.co.uk/">Watering Hole</a> (the UK's only beach bar), and drinking Pimms. 
A walk around the beach even yeilded another Kiwi Lifeguard who we spent an hour or so catching up with about home and what life was like lifeguarding in Cornwall.

We had an absolute stunner of a day!
