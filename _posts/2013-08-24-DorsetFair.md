<h4>Our first English County Fair!</h4>

Our first day of family holiday down in Dorset! We headed to the Oak Fair near Sturminster Newton and finally got to catch up with Andy and Tina and meet the kids for the first time.
There were owls, tractors, tea, a blow up pub and rain.It all felt like a proper welcome to an English summer holiday!
