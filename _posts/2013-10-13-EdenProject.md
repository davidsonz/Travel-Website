<h4>13/10/2013: A Splash of Summer</h4>

Today Louise and I caught the train along the Dawlish Coast to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.edenproject.com/">Eden Project</a> in Cornwall. 

The Eden Project is a fantastic day trip if you are ever in the South West. <br>
Comprised of two massive Bio Domes (Biomes) and surrounding gardens the Eden Project is a project in sustainability and community. The two Biomes are a Rainforest Biome and a Mediterranean Biome. There are also extensive gardens from all over the world surrounding the Biomes including a garden of New Zealand Flax and Grasses. 

There is also a canteen where you can eat your own food or buy if you so desire. All produce used at the canteen is locally harvested and seasonal. While we brought our own lunch we couldn't help but splurge on a cream tea. I was glad we only got one between two of us as the scones were massive!
