<h4>06/02/2015: We're all going on a Summer Holiday</h4>

It's time for our yearly migration to the beach for a week!

We are staying in Whangapoua in the Coromandel at a friend's bach which is awesome!
Whangapoua is just round the point from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thecoromandel.com/explore/listing/new-chums">New Chums Beach</a>, voted one of the top 10 beaches in the world. 

We spent the week swimming, kayaking, surfing and going for walks on the beach. We also visited the dairy (otherwise known as a convenience store or corner store) in Kuaotunu for a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.localist.co.nz/l/uekkvk">Killer Cone</a>. 
Had to be done really, what kind of summer holiday would it be without over indulging on Tip Top Ice-cream!
