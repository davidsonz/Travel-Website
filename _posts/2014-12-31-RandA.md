<h4>29/12/2014: Happy New Years from Wanaka</h4>

Louise and I are off to our first ever music festival for New Year's Eve, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rhythmandalps.co.nz/">Rhythm and Alps</a>.
We caught the Naked Bus down to Wanaka from Christchurch and spent a couple of nights with a friend of ours and a few days chilling out at the lake front before heading out to the festival.

<h4>30/12/2014: Rhythm and Alps</h4>

In true Davidson fashion, we over prepared for the music festival and had so much food we not only fed ourselves but our neighbour for the two nights of the festival.

The festival itself was amazing. The music was awesome, we had MO and Shapeshifter perform to name a couple, several stages and such a good atmosphere. 
The days were full of chilling out in the sunshine and catching up on sleep before the music started again. 
The last night of the festival was New Year's Eve, which was an awesome way to ring in the New Year. 

Unfortunately the last bus back into town was at 6am on the 1st so Louise and I were up before dawn to pack up the tent and head into town.
We had a few hours chilling out at the Lake before we hopped on our bus back to Christchurch.

<h4>02/01/2015: Akaroa</h4>

We had the 2nd of January with family out in Akaroa, a very cute town just outside of Christchurch that is well worth a visit if you are ever in the area, before we flew back to Auckland. 
We spent the day walking around the town before heading back to a friend's bach and having a play with the Jet Ski. 

All in all a very good New Years!
