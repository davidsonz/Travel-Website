<h4>A Day Out in Cardiff</h4>

Today Louise and I road tripped to Cardiff with Andy, Tina and the Kids. 
Andy and Tina were off to take the kids to visit Tina's Grandfather who live just outside of Cardiff so Louise and I jumped at the opportunity to Roadtrip with them there.
We trained down to Sherborne the night before and were off super early on Saturday morning. They dropped us at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/resident/Parking-roads-and-travel/parking/park-and-ride/Pages/default.aspx">Park and Ride</a> (a super easy option for anyone travelling into Cardiff as the bus is free), and we headed into Cardiff for the day.

Our first stop was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cardiffcastle.com/">Cardiff Castle</a> where we rented the audio guide and spent the morning learning the history of Cardiff. 
After that we went to the mall for lunch where we found a <a target="_blank" href="https://stdavidscardiff.com/eat/muffin-break">Muffin Break</a> (a NZ/Australian Cafe chain so super strange to find one in Wales) who were serving flat whites (still super uncommon in the UK at the time). 
To be honest, Wales feels a lot like home. The people are very friendly and the landscape is similar. Even our dislike of the Australians (in Rugby) is shared.

After lunch we headed down to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cardiffbay.co.uk/">Cardiff Bay</a> and the Millenium Centre (didnt have enough money to go inside but it was a beautiful area to walk around). 
Then it was a walk back up the main street to the centre and it was time to head back to meet Andy and Tina (just in time too, it was getting awfully cold and we were not appropriately dressed).
