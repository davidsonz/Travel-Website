<h4>30/11/2013: A Day Out in Cardiff</h4>

Today Louise and I road tripped to Cardiff with Andy, Tina and the Kids. <br/>
Andy and Tina were taking the kids to visit Tina's Grandfather who lives just outside of Cardiff, so Louise and I jumped at the opportunity to spend the day with them and hitch a ride to Cardiff.<br/>
We trained down to Sherborne the night before and were off super early on Saturday morning. They dropped us at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ENG/resident/Parking-roads-and-travel/parking/park-and-ride/Pages/default.aspx">Park and Ride</a> (a super easy option for anyone travelling into Cardiff as the bus is free), and we headed into Cardiff for the day.

Our first stop was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cardiffcastle.com/">Cardiff Castle</a> where we rented the audio guide and spent the morning learning the history of Cardiff. It was an extremely interesting tour and was good value for money (always important for a student). It is best to go on a good day as a lot of the tour is outside, either that or be prepared for the elements. 

After that we went to the local Westfield mall for lunch where we found a <a target="_blank" href="https://stdavidscardiff.com/eat/muffin-break">Muffin Break</a>. Muffin Break is a NZ/Australian Cafe chain so it was super strange to find one in Wales. However they were serving the home comforts like flat whites and egg sandwiches so we were happy. To be honest, Wales feels a lot like home. The people are very friendly and the landscape is similar, even our love for the great sport of rugby is shared.

After lunch we headed down to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cardiffbay.co.uk/">Cardiff Bay</a> and the Millennium Centre. We didn't have enough money to go inside but it was a beautiful area to walk around. Followed by a walk back up the main street to the centre and it was time to head back to meet Andy and Tina. It was a beautiful day but, as is standard in Autumn, it was getting awfully cold in the evening and we were not appropriately dressed.
