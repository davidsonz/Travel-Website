<h4>01/01/2016: Sunshine, Shopping, and Abbeys</h4>

Today we went to Sherborne to walk around in the New Year sun. 
We did a bit of shopping and had a lovely cup of tea and lunch at the local cafe before we went and had a look the the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sherborneabbey.com/">Sherbourne Abbey</a>.
It is a very beautiful Abbey, in a very quaint English town, and is well worth a visit if you are ever in that part of the world.
