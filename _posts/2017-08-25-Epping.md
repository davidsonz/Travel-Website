<h4>25/08/2017: Inter Zealand Competition</h4>

After being in England for a week we are finally back in Epping. What is normally the first stop when we visit the UK this trip has been our last.

Our family friends from Holland were also visiting today and we spent the day relaxing in the sunshine, playing Blikietrap (Dutch Football Hide and Seek) and having a Badminton Competition. There was one injury of the day when Louise and our friend's daughter played a bit of Chicken and ran head first into each other, Louise came off worse!

<h4>26/08/2017: Cressing Barns and Cream Tea</h4>

Today we went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://cressingbarns.co.uk/">Cressing Barns</a> for a walk around the gardens and Cream Tea. It is a very nice spot and only a half hour drive from Epping. The grounds are very beautiful, there were about three weddings happening on the grounds that day and I can see why it is a popular spot to get married.

<h4>27/08/2017: Last Day in England</h4>

Today was our last day in England before we headed back to Heathrow to fly to Russia to begin the Trans-Siberian. 

The day was passed in summer bliss of relaxing in the sun, playing badminton, golf in the back yard and chatting to Aunty Cathy, Steve and Grandad. It all felt very posh and we were making the most of our last day of relaxation before we hit the ground running in Russia. 

Its been a lovely week in the UK seeing everyone but now it is time to start the next adventure!
