<h4>Our last train - 6,304-7,622km</h4>

We are on our very last train of our train adventure, which started at 5am this morning as the train departed Ulaanbaatar at 6.30am. The train is full of tourists, the train from Ulaanbaatar to Beijing only runs twice a week after the summer months and so everyone who is travelling along this route ends up on the same train. We have some Dutch tourists that we bumped into a few times in Mongolia and a bunch of French Pensioners. <br/>
Our new friends from the Ger Camp, Holly and Ayra, came to say hi and we went on an explore to the dinig cart at one point. Annoyingly, you can only order a set menu on the Chinese Dining cart so none of us got anything.

Everything you read about not being able to access a bathroom for hours at the border crossings is true of the Mongolia/China border so we havent drunk anything except for the smallest sips of water since last night. <br/>
The new train is a Chinese train and super modern, we no longer have opening windows because we have air conditioning. Which is great when we are moving but when we stop it gets extremely hot on the train as we are passing through the Gobi Desert and the air con stops when the train does. But at one of the stops I made friends with the lovliest dog, I am looking forward to being home with mine now. 

So here is how the border crossing goes on the China/Mongolia border. <br/>
1. We arrive at the Mongolian border. The batrooms have been closed for about half an hour at this point, keep an eye on the time as the train attendants will not warn you ahead of the bathrooms closing.
2. The Mongolian customs officers come round and do passport control at the Mongolia border, this takes about an hour or so. The Mongolian border officers have been much more relaxed than the Russians thus far. 
3. Our passports are returned to us and we travel the half an hour to the Chinese border (not long enough for them to open the toilets).
3. The Chinese customs officers come around and collect your passports, you must be in your own cabin for this bit. They really didnt like the fact that Louise and I were twins, they kept having us stand up side by side and inspecting our passports.
4. You then stay on the train as you go to a warehouse where the buggies are changed for the new track width of China, a very interesting experience to watch. 
5. They then take you back to the border where they give you back your passport, and about 5 or so hours after the process began, you are allowed off the train and access to a bathroom.
We were prepared and hadn't drunk anything since the night before but many were not (there were a lot of people throwing suspiciously coloured drinking bottles in the bin). <br/>
By this point it was 2am and we were skulling back water like our lives depended on it. They also play pipe music continuously at the Chinese border. Which is a bit much when its 2am you are dehydrated and have a splitting headache.

So after a total of 8272km, 7 days, 7 nights, and two border crossings on our big train adventure, we have survived (just). I will be happy not to see a train for a while now though, I am pleased we are flying home to New Zealand.
