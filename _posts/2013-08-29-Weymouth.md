<h4>It finally feels like a summer holiday!</h4>

After a week on the coast we finally got a proper beach day!
Mum and Grandad headed to Shaftsbury for the day and the rest of us hit Weymouth beach for one last day all together before we all go our seperate ways. We spent the day surfing, swimming, making sand castles and eating ice creams and fish and chips.
It has been such a good week on the South Coast, I look forward to doing it again some day.
