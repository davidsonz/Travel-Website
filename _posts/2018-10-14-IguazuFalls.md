<h4>14/10/2018: Day 1 - Argentina</h4>

Welcome to Disneyland! 

I think the Iguazu Falls are the Latin American version of Disneyland. We walked to the bus station and queued there, then we arrived at the park and queued for tickets, then we queued to get into the park.
But Disneyland is amazing and worth every minute of the queuing. The minute we walked into the park we saw our first wildlife, the cutest little mammal called at Coati. It is like a cross between a Lima and a Racoon but is so so cute.

We walked the Lower Circuit first. It was a great start to the day as you are below the waterfalls and the views looking up at the falls we fantastic. You got soaking wet as you walked too close to them from the spray though. 

After a quick snack break we walked the Upper Circuit. The Upper Circuit was extremely busy as it is wheelchair friendly which also means that it is Pram friendly. The views from the Upper Circuit are pretty good as you look down on the falls and across to Brazil. I did like the Lower Circuit better with the views up into the falls. 
We stopped for lunch at a park bench in the jungle of the Upper Circuit, as we were sitting there we saw a Toucan fly by which was amazing!

Our last part of the day we headed up to the Devil's Throat at the top of the park. We decided to walk the 20km return trip because we didnt want to queue for the train. 
The walk up was good, but we were pretty tired by the time we got back down to the park to get the bus home. 
The Devil's Throat was absolutely amazing, standing above the Devils Throat was just a one of a kind experience. However, I do not want to think about the people limit on that platform becuase whatever it is I am sure that it was being exceeded.

<h4>15/10/2018: Day 2 - Argentina</h4>

Day two in Disneyland!

Today we are travelling to Foz do Iguacu in the afternoon so we only have the morning in the park. So today we are just doing the Lower and Upper Circuits this morning. 
We had a great time walking the circuits today, though we did do the Upper Circuit first so that we could see the Upper Circuit before the prams arrived. No Toucan today though unfortunately. 

Once we finished at the park we ran to catch the bus to Brazil!
The whole process is slightly ridiculous. Because everyone has to be stamped in and out of Argentina the bus waits for you at the Argentina border, but only foreigners need to be stamped in and out of Brazil so you have to wait for the next bus.
The weird thing is is that if you dont tell the Bus driver that you need to get off at the border they will just drive straight through. No one seems to care if you get checked into Brazil properly until you try to leave!

Our hostel in Foz do Iguacu is amazing, it is called the <a target="_blank" href="http://iguassuecohostel.com/">Iguassu Eco Hostel</a>. We are right next to the falls, practially in the park. We can walk there tomorrow morning!

<h4>16/10/2018: Day 3 - Brazil</h4>for te

Today we are on the Brazil side of the Iguazu falls. Unlike the Argentina side there is only one path on the Brazil side. You definitely only need one day on this side of the falls. 
You take a bus from the entrance to the park down to the path in the falls. 

The view across to the other side of the river is amazing, you can see the whole falls. You finish the path by walking into the Devil's Throat. You get completely soaked to the bone within 2 seconds!

We ate lunch at the top of the Devil's throat, looking out onto Argentina. Such a bizarre experience. 

Unfortunately our flight is not until later tonight but it means that we get to chill out on the sun loungers at the Hostel for a bit longer. But we cant shower so I feel a bit bad for the people who have to sit next to us on the plane!
