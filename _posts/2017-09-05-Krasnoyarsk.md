<h4>Trans Siberian Day Four - 4,065-5,153km</h4>

Our last night on the train. After the excitement of yesterday we were quite happy to have another day of naps, books and landscapes today. If I was feeling a bit sorry for myself this morning, our Russian army friends next door were even worse. Especially one of them, while being very ill and very hung over he was also being yelled at quite a lot by one of the train ladies this morning. We did not see much of them for the rest of their time on the train. 

We bought ice creams with the other tour groups just after lunch and then joined them for a last night meal in the dinig car. We got a couple of types of pancakes and some pepsi. The dining cart was not as over priced as what I was led to believe, though the babushkas we have been buying food from for the rest of the journey are much cheaper.

We arrive in Irkurst tomorrow morning, and while I have really enjoyed our time on the train, I am looking forward to a bed that doesnt move. 

We have a couple of long stops today:
* Taishet
* Illanksya
* Zima

List of entertainment consumed on the train thus far:
* Books read - 3
* Movies watched - 4
* Naps had - definitely lost count now
* Russian Army avoiding us - 4 

New favourite foods:
* Dehydrated potato (especially with long last cheese)
* Sunflower Honey in Black Tea
* Mystery meat (and sometimes cabbage) parcels
* Smoked cheese snacks
