<h4>Day One: 10/09/2013</h4>

We flew from Stansted to Amsterdam this morning and I couldn't believe how short the flight was! It took us longer to get from the car to the gate than it did for us to get to a new country!
I am sure to people who live in Europe this sounds obvious, but I live in New Zealand. The closest country is at least a three hour flight away and a 45 minute flight would only get you from Auckland to Wellington.

After checking into the hostel it started to rain so we had a quick wander around the canals before finding a pancake house for lunch. 
After lunch we went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amsterdamtulipmuseum.com/en/">Tulip Mueseum</a>, which was very touristy but as a person who love Tulips it was a cool place to go. 
It is also quite eye opening as many people who lived in Holland through the war had to eat Tulip bulbs to survive. 
There is a very good book called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/books/review/Lappin-t.html">The Hatred of Tulips</a>, which is a fictional but accurate portrayal of the starvation that people in Holland went through in the war and the lengths it drove them to.
We then went over to the Anne Frank House, we didnt expect to be able to get in as we had not booked tickets (which I highly recommend you do), but luckily because of the rain people did not feel like waiting in line so there weren't many people around and we just walked in.
The Anne Frank House is amazing and a must visit of Amsterdam, it is unimaginable how they lived in this space for as long as they did and stayed sane.
