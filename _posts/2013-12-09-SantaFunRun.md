<h4>A day out with all the Santas in the world</h4>

Today Louise and I partook in the Charity 5 mile <a target="_blank" href="http://stursantastride.co.uk/">Santa Stride</a> in Sturminster Newton. 
It was a beautiful day for it and we had a lot of fun. However, as we had had the Yule Ball with the Harry Potter Society the night before we spent much of the afternoon asleep!
