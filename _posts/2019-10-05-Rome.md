36 hectic hours in Rome! We were off on another weekend get away in Europe, this time to the Eternal City in order to tick off our 5th World Wonder!

We hit the ground running on Saturday. After checking into our hotel we started to walk down to the Vatican with a stop for lunch on the way. We had the best pasta of my life for lunch at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ristorantemargotprati.it/">Ristorante Margot</a>, I had the artichoke pasta and it was heaven. We then had a panic as we read on our tickets that we needed proof of ID to get into the Vatican so we had to power walk back to the hostel, and then back to the Vatican. We made it on time just. I would highly recommend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en.html">booking tickets online</a> for the Vatican as by the time we went into our 2pm tour the line was wrapped around the block several times. The Vatican was amazing. We did the guided tour through the muesum collections and the Sistine Chapel. It was beautiful, and very impressive. I was a little disappointed in the Sistine Chapel from the perspective that people were not respecting it as a Holy place, but it was still beautiful. After the Vatican we went and had some wine and pizza at a near by restaurant before heading over to the Trevi Fountain with a stop for gelato on the way. The Trevi Fountain was packed, even at 10pm at night.

On Sunday we went to the Pantheon first thing before the queues started forming. We managed to walk right inside with no waiting and have a look around. After that it was time for a leisurely breakfast over a couple of coffees. We then walked up to the Colosseum to have a look at the outside, of course the one weekend we were in Rome it was free entry into the Colosseum and so we would have had to queue for the entire day to go in. We then went to meet up with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.romefreewalkingtour.com/en/">free walking tour</a> which was a good way to learn about some of the history of the city. Then it was time to head back to Bristol. Apparently we have gotten a bit too relaxed with our attitudes towards flying now. We caught the last possible train to the airport, which then got delayed for 45 minutes and ended with us sprinting through the airport and onto the plane.

Fantastic weekend! 5 Wonders of the World done, 2 to go!
