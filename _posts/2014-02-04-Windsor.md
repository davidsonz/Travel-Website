<h4>04/02/2014: Our last trip in the UK before we head home</h4>

Louise and I are off on our last trip in England before we begin our journey back to NZ.

We headed to Windsor to stay with some family friends for a couple of nights and have a look around. 
Now that we are at the end of our trip we had no money left in the budget to go into the castle but we had a nice walk around it and around the town.

We walked back along the Thames River, until we paused to take some photos and a selfie or two and the swans attacked. 
They are so used to tourists stopping and feeding them they assume if you come to a stop you will feed them and they will come after you for food.
I am not a big fan of swans, back in NZ we have lots of black swans that are truly evil and I don't think the white ones are much better. 

It was a nice last trip, but now it is time to pack and get ready for the next adventure. Utah here we come!
