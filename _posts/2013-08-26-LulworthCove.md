<h4>First day of our family beach holiday!</h4>

After trying Weymouth this morning we headed to Lulworth Cove this afternoon where it was much nicer weather! We even got to see Durdle Door.
The Jurassic Coast is an extremely beautiful part of the UK, and the rock formations are amazing, it reminds me a bit of NZ.
