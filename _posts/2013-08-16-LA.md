<h4>Day One: 17/08/2013</h4>

Our first full day in Los Angeles and we are off to the shops! You've got to love how cheap everything in America is, and the fact that you can find everything. We even found a candy store that did bacon flavoured chocolate!

<h4>Day Two: 18/08/2013</h4>

Day two and we are heading to the beach! We caught the number 47 bus to New Port beach. We had a great time walking between the piers, going for a swim and stopping for a chat to the lifeguards (one of the girls from Mairangi Bay had been on exchange at New Port a couple of weeks prior to our arrival so they new all about New Zealand). Awesome to swim in the other side of the Pacific from home, but it definitely wasn't warm!

<h4>Day Three: 19/08/2013</h4>

Disney Land!

Louise had us on the first shuttle from the hotel to Disney Land this morning so we were up at 6am, which felt like 2am with the jetlag!
Totally worth it though, we hit all of the top rides before the park got busy and had an awesome day! Mum went back to the hotel after dinner but Louise and I stuck around for the light show and fireworks. 
It truely is the most magical place on earth!

<h4>Day Four: 20/08/2013</h4>

Our last day in America and we were at California Adventure World! 
Awesome last day in LA, though extremely hot, and I got to meet Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse! Louise forced me onto the roller coaster which was terrifying but a lot of fun, even if I needed a hug afterwards.
Mum loved the William Tell Swing ride and had us go on it four times throughout the course of the day.
