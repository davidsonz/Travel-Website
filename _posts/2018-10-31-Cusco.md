<h4>Bring it on Cusco!</h4>

We spent two and a half days in Cusco acclimitizing to the altitude. We are at 3400m above sea level here, which is higher than the start of the Inca Trail or even Machu Picchu. 

Upon arrival we completely understood why it is recommended to give yourself a few days to get used to the altitude before undertaking something like the Inca Trail.
We spent the first day and a half completely winded, with upset stomachs, sore heads and finding every task leaving us out of breath. Slowly we got used to the altitude and by the morning of the Inca Trail we were all feeling a lot better. 
We even managed to drag ourselves in a loop around all the churches in Cusco, which are all well worth a visit and you can buy a combined ticket which will let you into the top 6.

Louise and I also celebrated our 25th birthday while in Cusco! We are now a quarter of a century old if you can belive it. Our birthday present to ourselves was to hold baby goats with the local ladies who walk around with them in their slings. 
There are all sorts of these photo ops avaliable in Cusco, including llamas and alpacas, and are a lot of fun. 

We were in Cusco for Halloween (or All Hallows Eve), All Saints Day, and All Souls Day. All of these are holidays in this region of Peru so there were lots of celebrations and traditional foods to buy in the markets. If you are ever in Cusco check out the San Pedro Market if you want a true glimpse into local life.
