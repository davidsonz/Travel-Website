<h4>Christmas and Harry Potter - The perfect combination</h4>

Our first winter Christmas and we have gone for an explore in London with Louise and Lucy!

It is completely magical at this time of year with the Christmas Lights down Oxford street, the store fronts, the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland and the chill in the air. I love our NZ Summer Christmases but I can see the argument for Winter ones too.

Had to stop by King's Cross and try to get onto the Platform, never turn down an opportunity for Harry Potter!
