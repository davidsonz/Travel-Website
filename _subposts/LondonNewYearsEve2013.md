<h4>31/12/2013: Happy New Year Everyone!</h4>

Louise, Aunty Cathy, Claudia and I all headed to the Embankment to ring in the New Year! 

We got there early and got a good spot right opposite the Eye! We were so confused when we were packing for the night. Aunty Cathy kept reminding us to bring layers and blankets. I guess that while a Winter Christmas makes sense becuase its always on TV, a Winter New Years Eve took a bit longer for us to wrap our heads around. 

There was a crazy number of people! At one point in the night Claudia and I went to find the loos. They were only a couple of hundred metres away but it took us an hour to get there and back. We met some awesome people, including two volunteer Police Officers we ended up ringing in the New Year with. They kindly turned a blind eye to our Sparkling wine that was pulled out at midnight (it was supposed to be a liquor ban). After the Fireworks we were all funneled back into Traflagar Square to then disperse from there into various tube stations, it took a long time to get home but at least the Tubes run all night on New Years Eve.

We had the last New Years Eve in London when it was free entry, it is now ticket limited and you can find information on how to get tickets <a target="_blank" href="https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/new-years-eve-fireworks-in-london-how-to-get-tickets?package_page=78246">here</a>.
