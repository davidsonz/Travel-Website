<h4>A Museum Day Nerding out with our friends</h4>

We headed into London today with one mission: Hit the Museums! 
Louise and I are determinded to see as many of the London Museums as possible before we leave and today we tick off two of the biggest; 
The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/">Science Museum</a>.

The Science Museum is actually the main point of the trip, they are currently hosting an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/what-was-on/collider">LHC (Large Hadron Collider) Exhibit </a> that is touring the world.
With it being Christmas break all my Physics friends (plus a couple of extras) thought it would be the ideal excuse for a day out. 

The British Museum is amazing but huge! There is a good option to do the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/planning_your_visit/object_trails/1_hour.aspx">Top 9 Things</a>.
This is a good option if you are short on time and if you do them in order you end up seeing most of the museum anyway.
