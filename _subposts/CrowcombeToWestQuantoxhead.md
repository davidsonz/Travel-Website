<h4>05/10/2013: 7 miles from Crowcombe to West Quantoxhead</h4>

Today we completed a beautiful walk near the Somerset Coast through farm land from Crowcombe to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quantockonline.co.uk/quantocks/villages/westquantoxhead/westquantox1.html">West Quantoxhead</a>. 

In the morning President Pete had warned us that there were two big hills to climb so to pace ourselves. Louise and I have now discovered that the English idea of a big hill is vastly different to the New Zealand one. 

An absolute stunner of a day, we had beautiful blue skies the whole walk. We got to see some cows and walk through the bush (or forest as they call it in England). <br> 
The day lived up to the OODs motto "On a good day we can see Wales". When we got to West Quantoxhead and could see all the way across the Bristol Channel to the South Coast of Wales.
