<h4>Day One: Kiwi's and Kiwi Burgers</h4>

Arrived in London after a three hour drive from Bristol and checked into our hostel, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.parkvilla.co.uk/">Park Villa Hostel</a> in Grove Road. Super easy to get to, only three turns after we got off the M25, outside the congestion zone and parking is only Â£10 a night if you book through a third party website and included if you book directly with Park Villa. We had a very comfortable private room with shared bathroom in the basement that was nice and cool in the middle of a London summer. The Hostel is only a five minute walk from the local tube station and in zone 2 so transport is cheap.

Once we checked in we hightailed it into central London to do some shopping before meeting up with our Kiwi Expat friends, now living near London, for dinner at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gbk.co.uk/">GBK</a> (Gourmet Burger Kitchen) which is a New Zealand styled burger restaurant that does proper Kiwi Burgers with beetroot and egg (Nom!), they even have L&P on the menu!

<h4>Day Two: Harry Potter!</h4>

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was amazing! We had an absolute blast through the whole thing, it was magic come to life on stage with no green screen or special effects. We were on the edge of our seats the whole time! And no spoilers, as they say #keepthesecret
