<h4>West End Shows, Museums, and a Heat Wave</h4>

We finally got our first proper day in London and it was amazing!

After battling the crowds on the tube we made it into central London. We went to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/">London Transport Museum</a> and walked around all the major land marks.
The transport museum was well worth a visit, and for no extra charge you can upgrade your ticket to a yearly pass. It takes you through the full history of the London tube, social and technological. 

We went to our first ever West End Show, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atgtickets.com/shows/spamalot/playhouse-theatre/">Spamalot</a>. Made by the same people who bought us Monty Python this show was fall out of your seat funny!
