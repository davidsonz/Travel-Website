<h4>Finally some familiar faces</h4>

We headed into London today to meet up with the Couchmans who are here for the week as part of their holiday.
We had a great day out visiting the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/">V&A Museum</a>, 
the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a> and walking along <a target="_blank" href="https://southbanklondon.com/index">South Bank</a>. 
It was so nice to be around family again, we had such a good day and found some awesome new spots in London the Alec and Barb knew about from when they used to live here.
