<h4>Seek and you shall find!</h4>

We spent the day running around Bristol as fast as we could to complete the <a target="_blank" href="https://visitbristol.co.uk/things-to-do/banksy-walking-tour-p1354013">Banksy Tour</a> and find as many Grommits as we could before the drive back to London. The Grommits were statues from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gromitunleashed.org.uk/">Grommit Unleashed</a> exhibition that was on in the city that summer, it is coming again for the summer of 2018!
I love all the street art in Bristol, it makes it such a vibrant fun city to be in!
