<h4>13/12/2015: 10 Miles from Feniton to Wimple</h4>

Today we walked the 10 miles from Feniton to Wimple for the second time for an OODs Reunion walk as Louise and I are back in Exeter for the week for a visit.

We had a great day for it, a bit muddy but no rain and we made friends with a local horse. There were jokes to be had, stories to tell and a lot of fun had by all. 

Feniton to Wimple, to me, is the perfect English Countryside walk. You train there and back from Exeter, walk through some farms and past a few quaint little towns and at the end there is a Pub to grab a drink before you head back to the city.
