<h4>10 Miles from Feniton to Wimple</h4>

Today we walked the 10 miles from Feniton to Wimple for the second time for an OODs Reunion walk as Louise and I are back in Exeter for the week for a visit.
We chose this walk because it had such good memories associated, and there is a pub at the end.
We had a great day for it, a bit muddy but no rain and we made friends with a local horse.
