<h4>The old family summer holiday stomping ground</h4>

After hearing about Mum and Aunty Cathy's stories of their summer holidays at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lymeregis.org/">Lyme Regis</a> as children all week we finally got to visit. 
I am still getting used to this pebble beach thing, but at least it keeps the water nice and warm. Another thing I could definitely get used to about the English beaches is that you can buy a cup of tea as easily as you can buy an ice cream here!
