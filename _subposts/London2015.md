<h4>23/12/2015: Our exploits in London during our 2015 trip to the UK</h4>

We are back in the London area and we are ticking off all the things we couldn't afford to do two years ago.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/exhibitions/ice-rink.html">Ice Skating</a>!

We finally went Ice Skating in London! We went to the one at the Natural History Museum, everyone told us the Somerset house one was the more traditional but this was the one we wanted to do.

We were joined by Louise and Lucy for the day. Lucy was less than enthusiastic for the Ice Skating but we all survived and headed to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.choccywoccydoodah.com/">Choccywoccydoodah</a> for Hot Chocolates and Brownies afterwards.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory">The Greenwich Observatory</a>!

Our Christmas present from Aunty Cathy was tickets to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.disneyonice.com/nz/en-nz/100-years-of-magic">Disney on Ice</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theo2.co.uk/">O2</a> on Boxing Day so on the way we hit up the Greenwich Observatory.

We caught the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thamesclippers.com/route-time-table/prices">Thames Clipper</a> boats along the river to the O2 and then walked through the Greenwich foot tunnel under the river to the observatory.

The Observatory is a very interesting place. From the maritime and time keeping history of England to the grounds themselves you will find quite a few hours of entertainment here.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stpauls.co.uk/">St Paul's</a>!

St Paul's is a great place to check out. The inside is amazingly detailed and you can walk up to the top of the roof and get a 360 view of London.
You are not really supposed to take photos inside St Paul's (not that that stopped us) but you can take as many as you want on the outside.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/">The Tower of London</a>!

The Tower of London is very good, but get there early before the crowds start building and make a beeline for the Crown Jewels section. 
We bought our tickets online the night before so got to skip the queue, collect our tickets and head straight in. Our mistake was to do the Crown Jewels last. When we arrived there was no queue but by the time we got to it the queue was huge. Well worth the wait though. 

The Tower of London is one of the more captivating museums that you can visit, they make the history interesting and it is a great time to walk around the complex. 

After you have finished make sure to walk across Tower Bridge to get a view of it from the other side of the river.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.londoneye.com/">The London Eye</a>!

Once again we bought our tickets for this the previous night which was just as well because, by the time we got here around lunch, the queues were huge! We lost Louise taking photos and were a bit worried we'd never find her again!
The London Eye is fantastic, beautiful views over the whole of London and a lot of fun.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.londonaquaticscentre.org/">The London Aquatics Centre</a>!

In fairness, this actually wasn't open the last time we were over as they had yet to open the Pool for the London Olympic 2012 Games to the Public. We still had to go check it out this time. 

A very nice pool to swim in, but make sure to check your times before you go as it is only open to the public at certain times of the day.
