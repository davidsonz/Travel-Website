<h4>Back to Hogwarts we go!</h4>

Happy Yule!

We are back at the Harry Potter Studios Tour, and this time its all done up for Christmas! We had a great time at the Studios with Louise, we did wand lessons and drank butterbeer<br>
Louise (twin) and I even got to open the doors to the Great Hall. We won the contest of who had travelled that furthest, we just claimed New Zealand instead of Exeter.
