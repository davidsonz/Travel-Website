<h4>Back to Hogwarts we go!</h4>

We are back at the Harry Potter Studios Tour, and this time ots all done up for Christmas!
We had a great time at the Studios with Louise, we did wand lessons, drank butterbeer, and Louise (twin) and I even got to open the doors to the Great Hall (we won the contest of who had travelled that furthest).
