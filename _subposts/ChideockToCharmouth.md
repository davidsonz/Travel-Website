<h4>02/02/2014: 6 miles from Chideock to Charmouth</h4>

Today we walked the 6 miles from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/walksdb/693/">Chideock to Charmouth</a> via the Golden Cap. 

Today was Louise and my last OODs walk (or official one anyway) as we head off to the States and then back home in the next couple of weeks. 

All our friends turned out for the last walk, including another kiwi, Isabelle who is on exchange in London and came down for a visit. 

Being part of OODs has been one of the best parts of our time at Exeter, if you ever get the chance to join I couldnt recommend more.
