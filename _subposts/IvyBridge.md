<h4>12/01/2014: 8 miles around the Ivy Bridge circular</h4>

Today we headed off to do a circular walk through the Dartmoor to the <a target="_blank" href="http://pinns.co.uk/devon/ivybridge.html">Ivy Bridge</a> and back. 

We were joined by Claudia (who is over visiting from Germany) and Louise R on the walk which lead to a very fun day out post exams. Louise (twin) was unable to join us as she still had an exam to go so had to study instead.
